# Mastermind

Mastermind coding challenge, based on the [board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).

The application will generate a secret sequence of four colours. To win the game, you must guess this sequence in ten moves or fewer. As you make each guess, the app will respond with colours: white for the number of colours in the right spot, red for correct colours in the wrong spot, and black for any wrong colours.
